# lyrics_search

## Description

A website that allows a user to enter a song lyric, title, or artist name and it will return a list of songs featuring that pharse or band. The user can also select a song and get the full lyrics of that song displayed onto the screen. The website uses lyric.ovi api to fetch artists, artist, and lyrics. Async await is used to fetch and parse JSON files which are then injected into the DOM.
